## In Brief

If you are familiar with R and [rtweet](https://rtweet.info/) run the snippet below from a newly created directory or RStudio project and jump to [Configure section](#configure). Otherwise follow along this document.

```r
install.packages("remotes", repos = "https://cran.rstudio.com")
remotes::install_github("JohnCoene/chirp") # install
chirp::build_nest() # create config file
chirp::check_nest() # check config file
chirp::chirp() # launch
```

## Install

Chirp is written in [R](https://www.r-project.org/), the programming language must thus be installed on your machine. Once installed follow the instructions below to setup a working Chirp platform on your local machine.

First, create an empty directory where to host Chirp.

```bash
mkdir chirp
cd ./chirp
```

Chirp is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/JohnCoene/chirp) and can be installed using the `remotes` package.

<!--DOCUSAURUS_CODE_TABS-->
<!--R-->
```r
install.packages("remotes", repos = "https://cran.rstudio.com")
remotes::install_github('JohnCoene/chirp')
```
<!--Terminal-->
```bash
R -e "install.packages('remotes', repos = 'https://cran.rstudio.com');\remotes::install_github('JohnCoene/chirp')"
```

<!--END_DOCUSAURUS_CODE_TABS-->

## Initialise

Now we can initialise Chirp. Make sure you are running this from the _root of the directory_ where you want the application hosted. The command below will create a default configuration file called `_chirp.yml` and open it in your terminal or [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/).

<!--DOCUSAURUS_CODE_TABS-->
<!--R-->
```r
chirp::build_nest()
```
<!--Terminal-->
```bash
R -e "chirp::build_nest()"
```
<!--END_DOCUSAURUS_CODE_TABS-->

The configuration file (`_chirp.yml`) allows you to customise Chirp and hold Twitter credentials. 

## Configure

Chirp comes integrated with the [Twitter Search API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/search/api-reference/get-search-tweets.html), and therefore needs to be able to access or create a Twitter token (using [rtweet](https://rtweet.info/)). 

The credentials are somewhat particular, either:

1. You have already used the `rtweet` package in which case Chirp will use your internally saved credentials: you can thus jump straight to the [Check section](#check).
2. You have never used `rtweet` on your machine; simply follow along to get setup.

There is probably a third possibility, the above confuses you as you are not familiar with R or `rtweet` in which case keep reading.

You can obtain the keys and tokens mentioned in `_chirp.yml` under `credentials` by heading to [apps.twitter.com](https://apps.twitter.com) and creating an application. Fill in the form however you see fit, the only thing of importance is to fill in the "Callback URLs" with `http://127.0.0.1:1410`.

With that done head to the "Keys and tokens" tab where you should find the information required in `_chirp.yml`:

```yaml
credentials:                    
  consumer_key: xXxxXXxxxxXXxxX
  consumer_secret: xXxxXXxxxxXXxxX
  access_token: xXxxXXxxxxXXxxX
  access_secret: xXxxXXxxxxXXxxX
```

## Check

Before we launch Chirp we can make sure that Chirp can run. The function below will print helpful messages to the console if issues are found.

<!--DOCUSAURUS_CODE_TABS-->
<!--R-->
```r
chirp::check_nest()
```
<!--Terminal-->
```bash
R -e "chirp::check_nest()"
```

<!--END_DOCUSAURUS_CODE_TABS-->

## Run

You can now run Chirp.

<!--DOCUSAURUS_CODE_TABS-->
<!--R-->
```r
chirp::chirp()
```
<!--Terminal-->
```bash
R -e "chirp::chirp()"
```

<!--END_DOCUSAURUS_CODE_TABS-->

The above will open your browser and you'll be ready to use Chirp.
