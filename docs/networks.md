## Introduction

The ultimate aim of Chirp is to let one analyse the structure and dynamics of social interactions on Twitter. This includes different interactions displaying different types of structures: this document explores the latter.

In brief, we explore some options available on the network screen under <i class="fas fa-pencil-ruler"></i>.

## Network types

You can build different kinds of networks, you will see three options under "network types," though using additional options you can build five different types of networks.

- Retweets
- Conversations
- Hashtags
- Conversations co-mentions
- Hashtags co-mentions

### Retweets

_Retweets_ is selected by default, it is, to the best of my knowledge, the most widespread form of Twitter network. It allows you to analyse how information spreads throughout the network as it displays a network connecting the user tweeting the original idea to users who retweet it.
