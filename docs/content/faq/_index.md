## Why Chirp?

Social Media is a data gold mine, however analytics platform of the latter tend to be rather poor. They usually take an inadequate approach to understanding social networks. Moreover most such services are not free.

While most services look at how your own timeline "performs" by presenting you with various aggregate metrics, Chirp shows you how user interact when discussing a particular topic or how information spreads throughout the social network.

## Why use networks?

Because Twitter is a network; information on the network is much more insightful when represented as such.

## What are the network type?

Right now, Kube is a self-sufficient, modern and complete product. We have no specific plans of adding any new components anytime soon; we do not plan to extend Kube as well. Our goal is to improve the things that make Kube so awesome by squashing bugs, refactoring the code and improving overall performance.

Having this said, we are keeping our eyes on what’s new in the world of HTML, CSS, and JS, and if something truly exciting happens in future with these technologies (comparable, let’s say, to flexbox emergence), we most certainly will consider these changes and will be first to go ahead and implement them as soon as possible.

## What are the clusters?

Old versions of Kube are critically outdated, and we strongly encourage you to stop using them as soon as you can. We do not offer old versions for download, and we do not provide old documentation. We realize that this may be an inconvenience, however, we also deeply believe that upgrading to the new Kube will bring way greater positive effect to your projects than the ability to support legacy versions.

## Under What license is Chirp released?

Nope. We want to keep Kube minimalistic, small and flexible. So, actually, there’s more chance of us removing stuff from the code and functions while preserving features, than adding new code and new stuff.
