This is an early launch of Chirp, still much needs to be improved and added to the software. It's honestly too early to release and should still be in development but I really wanted to submit it to the [Shiny Contest](https://blog.rstudio.com/2019/01/07/first-shiny-contest/) to see how it would fare.

This post gives an idea of the roadmap ahead of Chirp and some idea on how it was put together.

I more or less got where I wanted with the look and feel of the platform, I wanted something easy to install and deploy. In fact I aimed at making it so easy that (hopefully) those not familiar with R or programming can install and deploy it on their own: it's just a `yaml` configuration file and four lines of code after all. The interface is fairly easy to understand, I aimed at reproducing a search engine-like kind of feel, from the homepage it is pretty clear what you should do; a search, click submit and there is your network. However, much work still needs to be done on the substance to make Chirp more insightful.
